# Big Data Course: Final Project
The following repository contains the code files submitted for the Big Data course at Trent University in the term of Winter 2018.

## Project Title: Storage and Analysis System for Realtime Applications
### Abstract: 
Industrie 4.0 (or Smart Factory) is one of the prime contributors for generating large amount of real-time data in various organizations around the globe. The challenge with processing such data is that over time data generated long time ago becomes less useful, while the newly produced data is used more often. Use of traditional systems to process such a data could result in performance degradation of the system. In the following work author has proposed a design suitable for the needs of real-time applications. A wide spectrum of processing techniques and solutions had been reviewed for the system. Finally, the system was designed and implemented by using softwares: Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, Apache NIFI, Apache Spark, and MongoDB database. 

### Organization of the Repository:
* Config Folder: Configuration files for various softwares
* Codes Folder: 
1) Automation Scripts: Scripts to automate the launch process of the system
2) Kafka Scripts: Scripts to fetch data from twitter and store data in MongoDB
